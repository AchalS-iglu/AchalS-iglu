# Achal S.

**Applied AI / Backend Engineer**

I build production software where **latency, cost, reliability, and safety** are first‑class constraints — especially when integrating **LLMs** into existing systems.

- Backend systems • data-heavy apps • auth/RBAC • deployments & ops
- LLM/RAG in production • prompt + context engineering • evaluation & guardrails
- TypeScript + Python • SQL-first thinking • Linux debugging when things break

---

## What I’m optimizing for
- **Shipping** end-to-end features under real-world constraints (not demos)
- **Correctness & debuggability** (observability, safe fallbacks, defensive validation)
- **Cost/latency-aware AI** (treating tokens as a production resource)

---

## Highlights (selected)
- Designed and shipped **LLM-assisted workflows** inside an existing product (not greenfield)
- Built **LLM orchestration** with routing/access control/request shaping
- Worked on **high-scale analytics** and performance-minded query paths
- Owned fixes during production incidents across **Linux / DB / infra / deployment**

> Note: Some of my most impactful work is in private/regulated codebases; I share architecture + learnings publicly when I can.

## Tech I actually use
**Backend:** TypeScript/Node.js, Python, REST APIs, auth/RBAC, SQL

**AI/LLMs:** RAG (FAISS/BM25), prompt structuring, evaluation, hallucination mitigation, cost control

**Infra/Ops:** Docker, AWS (ECS/ECR/S3/IAM), CI/CD, Linux

## Open to
**Applied AI / backend roles** (product-minded, production-first). If you’re hiring for systems that need to be reliable *and* intelligent, I’d love to talk.
